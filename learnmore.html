        <h1>Why Help?</h1>
        <p>Dogs deserve compassion and care just like any other living being. 
            Providing them with shelter, food, and medical attention not only improves their well-being but also 
            contributes to safer and more harmonious communities. Helping stray dogs reflects our values of empathy 
            and responsibility towards all creatures sharing our world.</p>

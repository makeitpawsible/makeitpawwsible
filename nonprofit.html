        <h1>The Pawssion Project </h1>
        <p>The Pawssion Project Shelters in Bacolod City and SJDM, Bulacan currently houses over 600 rescued dogs and cats. 
            Our rescues are free-roaming, fully vaccinated, spayed & neutered and fed 2 times a day with snacks and vitamins! 
            We also employ 15 stay-in Caretakers, a part-time vet, and have built a small clinic in our Bulacan Shelter.</p>
        <p>Pawssion Project started in 2018, when we rescued dogs who were about to be killed by gunshot in the pound. We have 
            since conducted several other rescue operations from pounds, and each has left a lasting mark on us, the most potent
             being the sinking feeling in our hearts that no matter how many times we do it, we will not be able to save all.</p>
